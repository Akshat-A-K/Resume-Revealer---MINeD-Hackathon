ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Impact of Career Development Services in Career Outcomes
Sep 2020 - Dec 2020
 Quantified impact of NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development on students actual career outcomes
 Designed a framework to determine most important career coaching activities by developing Logistic Regression
(78% accuracy) and Decision Trees (87% accuracy) models having "Job Secure date" as target variable
Evaluating Summarization Tasks Using Sentence-BERT
Mar 2020 - May 2020
 Devised a novel metric by employing sentence embeddings from SentenceBERT for evaluation of Summarization
Tasks (Dataset- 226,711 BBC news articles)
 Validated SentenceBERT_Score correlates better to human evaluation than traditional evaluation metrics like ROUGE
and BLEU
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning
Jan 2018 - Dec 2018
 Identified Hard Exudates, Soft Exudates, Microaneurysm and Hemorrhages as key factors for detection; deployed
CNN models to identify Retinopathy (Sensitivity-0.94) and leveraged the Ensemble Method to ascertain stage of
Retinopathy
 Performed Data Augmentation and Image Segmentation leveraging Attention UNet; Conducted experiments for
generalization on datasets Messidor (1200 images), DiaretDB0(130 images) and DiaretDB1(84 images)
Job Recommendation Engine
Oct 2019 - Dec 2019
 Leveraged Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK 3.4) for extracting keywords about pertinent skills from job descriptions
and resumes
 Developed a Recommendation Engine by computing Cosine Similarity and utilized Hit Ratio for evaluating
performance of system- 46% hit rate increase over randomized recommendations for 100 recommendations
Optimal Location Prediction for Emergency Stations
Jul 2018 - Jan 2019
 Formulated ML/DL Models to identify best suitable model for Travel Time Estimation; Travel Time estimated from
XGBoost (RMSE: 42 seconds) was leveraged to drive K-Medoids for predicting optimal locations
 Decreased turnaround time along with reduced utility of resources; for Staten Island: average time cut down by 6
seconds utilizing 14 Fire Stations in comparison to 19 actual stations
